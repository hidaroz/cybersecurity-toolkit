# Cybersecurity Toolkit Research Phase

This document outlines the methodology used to research and categorize a range of cybersecurity tools. We leveraged **MITRE ATT&CK** for offensive (Red Team) tactics and the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** for defensive (Blue Team) practices.

---

## Methodology

### 1. Framework Selection

- **MITRE ATT&CK**:  
  Used for offensive (Red Team) perspective. We focused on common tactics and techniques:
  - Credential Access
  - Initial Access
  - Exfiltration
  - Command & Control (C2)
  - Data Collection

- **NIST CSF**:  
  Used for defensive (Blue Team) perspective. We categorized tools under:
  - Identify
  - Protect
  - Detect
  - Respond
  - Recover

### 2. Research Goals

1. **Tool Identification**  
   - Compare well-known, industry-standard tools for each phase of an attack/defense cycle.  
   - Evaluate both free (open-source) and paid (enterprise) solutions.

2. **Risk & Cost Analysis**  
   - Identify cost ranges (free, low cost, enterprise pricing).  
   - Discuss potential risks (legal, resource-intensive, ethical considerations).

3. **Learning Curve**  
   - Approximate time to learn or master each tool based on user skill levels.

4. **Trust Score**  
   - Assign a subjective rating (1â€“10) based on community reputation, reliability, and ethical usage considerations.

### 3. Data Collection Methods

- **Official Documentation**:  
  Gathered from vendor websites, GitHub repos, and open-source project pages.
- **User Guides / Online Tutorials**:  
  Consulted to understand setup complexity and typical use cases.
- **Security Community Feedback**:  
  Reviewed forums, blog posts, and security communities for real-world usage insights.

### 4. Ethical & Legal Considerations

- All offensive tools must be used with proper authorization.  
- Tools like **Mimikatz**, **John the Ripper**, and **Netcat** are powerful; misuse can result in legal consequences.  
- Defensive tools must comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., ensuring logs and scans respect privacy laws).
